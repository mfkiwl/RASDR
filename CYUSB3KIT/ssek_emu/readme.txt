USB BULK SOURCE SINK LED EXAMPLE
-------------------------------

  This example illustrates on how to configure the GPIO as an output and drive the LED.
  The LED will blink at different rates if the FX3 DVK is connected to a SuperSpeed USB port. The LED
  be mostly on for SS, 50%on for HISPEED, mostly off for LOWSPEED.
   
  This example illustrates the use of the FX3 firmware APIs to implement
  a data source and data sink over a pair of USB Bulk endpoints.

  The device enumerates as a vendor specific USB device with a pair of Bulk
  endpoints (1-OUT and 1-IN). The OUT endpoint acts as data sink and the IN
  endpoint acts as data source to the PC Host.

  The source and sink is achieved with the help of a a DMA MANUAL IN Channel 
  and a DMA MANUAL OUT Channel. 
  Any data received from the host through the DMA MANUAL IN channel is 
  discarded. 
  A constant data pattern is continuously loaded into the DMA MANUAL OUT 
  channel and sent to the host.

      This assembly source file follows the syntax for the GNU assembler.

    * cyfxbulksrcsink.h    : Constant definitions for the bulk source sink 
      application. The USB connection speed, numbers and properties of the 
      endpoints etc. can be selected through definitions in this file.

      are used by this firmware example. VID and PID is defined in this file.

      example.

  PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS

  The data transfer performance obtained using the firmware example depends on the
  endpoint burst length, as well as the size and number of DMA buffers used. These
  parameters can be varied through constants defined in the cyfxbulksrcsink.h header
  file. It is also possible to set them through the compiler command line. by adding
  them to the list of Pre-processor definitions in the Eclipse build settings.

  1. CY_FX_EP_BURST_LENGTH           : Defines the burst size for the endpoints.
                                       Set to 16 KB by default.
  2. CY_FX_BULKSRCSINK_DMA_BUF_SIZE  : Size of the DMA buffers used for the endpoints.
                                       Set to 32 KB by default.
  3. CY_FX_BULKSRCSINK_DMA_BUF_COUNT : Number of DMA buffers used for each endpoint.
                                       Set to 2 by default.
