Procedure for tuning RASDR with a calibrated noise source
=========================================================

0. Connect Noise Source to RX input on RASDR, but do not power it on
1. Start RASDRproc with no RASDR.cfg in the folder where the .exe is
2. Select Ctr Frequency, BW of interest
3. Set Samples/Frame = 256
4. Set RX Switch to 'RX->50o,Z->LNAx'
5. Set VGA2 Gain to '0'
5. Start capture
6. Observe the value under Frames per Second (it will show a value of X << N)
7. Set the averaging criteria to the nearest integer of the ratio (N/X)
  a. In my case it is 245
8. Press Correct DC Offset
9. Wait for the spectrum to stabilize
10. Add a marker and set it along the baseline somewhere, observe its value
  a. For example: -19.2dB
11. Open 'Define Output->Setup RSS Output'
  a. Set channels = 256, Set Channel Bias to the inverse of the value observed in step 10, rounded up.
  b. In this example: 20.0
  c. Set Enable
  d. Press OK/Close
12. Stop capture and start it again
13. Press Set PWR Reference
14. Adjust VGA2 Gain until the marker value reaches/slightly exceeds the value observed in step 10
  a. In my case it was 9dB
15. Press Correct DC Offset
16. Wait for the spectrum to stabilize
17. Set RX Switch to RX->LNA1
18. Set Autoscale PWR Axis and Time Axis, Span (min) to 1
19. Connect RSS Spectrograph to RASDR
20. Wait 1min
21. Power on the noise source, observe power graph level rises in proportion to expected noise power in band
  a. in my case, @1420MHz, my noise source is cal to 15.75dB(1420MHz) ENR at 25C, I observe a +10dB rise in the spectrum level with a +12uW rise in the ADC level.

TODO:
  Identify which parameters need to be adjusted in the PWR and SPECTRUM gain processing to correctly calibrate the PWR and spectral vertical scales.
