Blink Error Codes for 'usb_rx.img' Jun 26, 2016

Upon an error condition, the firmware will emit an error code sequence on LED D6 of the digiRED board.  It begins with a walk of all three LEDs, then describes a two-digit code by blinking all three LEDs with the most-significant, pause and blink the center LED once, then blink all three LEDs with the least significant digit.  This is followed by a pause and the code repeats beginning with the LED walk.  The codes are defined as follows:

01	Invalid USB Speed
02	Producer EP configuration failed at INITIALIZATION
03	Consumer EP configuration failed at INITIALIZATION
04	Consumer (PORT->USB) DMA channel creation failed
05	Consumer (PORT->USB) DMA activation failed
06	Consumer EP disable failed at RESET/DISCONNECT
07	P-PORT initialization failed
08	GPIF load failed
09	GPIF state machine start failed
10	USB Set Descriptor failure (SS)
11	USB Set Descriptor failure (HS)
12	USB Set Descriptor failure (SS BOS)
