The RASDRviewer source code has been withdrawn and Paul L. Oxley has asserted copyright on the parts that he has added to the original 'FFTviewer' project that was provided to the RASDR team by Lime Microsystems, Ltd. in July 2013.

The original 'FFTviewer' project was announced here:
https://myriadrf.org/blog/fast-fourier-transformation-software/

And it is currently maintained by Lime Microsystems, Ltd. here:
https://github.com/myriadrf/lms-suite/tree/master/LMS6002D/legacy/FFTviewer

Bogdan has continued to maintain the RASDR-specific code for the Open-Source community under a new name "RASDRproc" for the time being.  It is found ../RASDRproc/ in this repository.

Present: 

Paul, Bogdan, and David.

We agree to remove  the source from Github.

Paul and I will pay for MS  driver signing, assigned to Paul, or I buy a nice dinner.

Paul will be RASDRviewer owner. It's still open source.

We agreed on a specific Concept Engineering case. 

We agree on ext. power arrangement for RASDR3 and discussed/agreed on GPIO protection.

We're looking into forming an LLC.

Cheers,
David
